US storm leaves 1 million without power, forces 10,000 flight cancellations
WASHINGTON – More than 1 million customers in the US as far west as New Mexico were without electricity and over 10,000 flights were cancelled on Jan 25 during a monster winter storm that paralysed eastern and southern states with heavy snow and ice.
As snow, sleet, freezing rain and dangerously frigid temperatures swept into the eastern two-thirds of the nation on Jan 25, the number of power outages continued to rise. As of 2.16pm EST on Jan 25 (3.16am on Jan 26, Singapore time), more than 1 million US customers were without electricity, according to PowerOutage.us, with at least 330,000 in Tennessee and over 100,000 each in Mississippi and Louisiana.
Other states affected included Texas, Kentucky, Georgia, West Virginia and Alabama.
More than 10,800 US flights scheduled for Jan 25 were cancelled, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. Over 4,000 flights were cancelled on Jan 24.
Washington DC’s Ronald Reagan National Airport said airlines had cancelled all flights at the airport on Jan 25. FlightAware data indicated that more than 80 per cent of Jan 25 flights were cancelled for several airports in large metropolitan regions, including New York, Philadelphia and Charlotte, North Carolina.
Delta Air Lines on Jan 25 said that it intended to operate on a reduced schedule “subject to real-time frozen precipitation and afternoon storm conditions.”
The airline had adjusted its schedule on Jan 24, with additional cancellations in the morning for Atlanta and along the East Coast, including in Boston and New York City, and said it would move experts from cold-weather hubs to support de-icing and baggage teams at several southern airports.
