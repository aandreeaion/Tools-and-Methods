In this country, Ikea will offer an electricity plan: what are the conditions?
After furniture and solar panels, Ikea is launching into electricity supply. In Germany, the Swedish group will offer a plan indexed to wholesale market prices. This plan is reserved for consumers willing to adapt their usage.
A new arrival at Ikea: after the Billy bookcases and Friheten sofas, here comes "Svea Strom." No, it's not the Swedish retailer's latest coffee table. Furthermore, you won't find Svea Strom in France, as only Germans will be able to discover this new product. Specifically, it's a "dynamic" electricity plan, the price of which fluctuates according to stock market quotations. A world first for the group, which aims to democratize a model that is still relatively uncommon among individuals. "We want to make sustainable energy affordable and accessible to as many people as possible, regardless of their type of housing, income, or technical knowledge," says Jacqueline Polak of Ikea Germany. The electricity supplied will come from 100% renewable sources.
As an article in Les Echos indicates, this type of contract is not new in Germany. Since 2025, German suppliers have been required to offer dynamic tariffs: the price per kilowatt-hour is not fixed in advance but fluctuates according to the wholesale market, with changes every 15 minutes. To access these tariffs, customers must have a smart meter capable of measuring consumption in real time. This technical requirement explains why few households have taken the plunge so far. In France, this model remains marginal. Currently, only the supplier Sobry markets a "pure" dynamic tariff offer based on a kilowatt-hour price strictly aligned with the wholesale market, billed hourly, with no fixed term.
An attractive offer… for the right customers
In Germany, Ikea acts as an intermediary for Svea Strom. The smart meter installation and monitoring app are provided by Svea Solar, a Swedish company founded in 2014. This tool allows customers to anticipate off-peak hours the following day and adjust their usage accordingly. "Electricity consumption can be targeted to favorable time slots, for example, when the grid is heavily supplied with wind or solar power," Ikea points out. Prices are available the day before at 2 p.m. The monthly subscription fee is €6.99, or €5.95 for Ikea Family members, plus the cost of energy, taxes, and network charges.
Savings are possible, but they depend heavily on individual circumstances. Ikea suggests savings of up to €167 per year for a single person consuming 600 kWh, and up to €830 for a family with an electric car. Conversely, poorly managed consumption can quickly lead to higher bills. This offer should be approached with caution, therefore, and is clearly designed for households with heat pumps or electric vehicles, rather than for low-consumption households, as noted by Les Echos.
