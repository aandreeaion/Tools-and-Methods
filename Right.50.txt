How Trump's Plan to Take Over Greenland Shakes Up Life on the Arctic Island
Despite the US president's change in rhetoric from not annexing the island by force, Greenlanders remain vigilant against a possible occupation. Residents of the Arctic territory tell La Tercera how the diplomatic conflict with Washington has affected their daily lives and explain what is at stake.

In 2019, during his first term, Donald Trump first mentioned his intention to buy Greenland. Although he acknowledged it wasn't a priority at the time, the statement caught many off guard, especially Denmark, which controls the Arctic island as an autonomous territory. "This must be an April Fool's joke," former Danish Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen tweeted at the time. His successor, current Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, while echoing the sentiment, offered a more concise response. “Absurd,” he said.

With the start of Trump’s second term, the discussion resumed. The White House occupant escalated the demand for Greenland, calling the matter “absolutely necessary in the interest of national security.”

After the U.S. capture of Nicolás Maduro on January 3, the spotlight has been on Greenland. In a meeting with representatives of oil companies following the incursion into Caracas, Trump stated, “We’re going to do something about Greenland, whether we like it or not.”

Since then, various White House officials have confirmed the intention to take control of the world’s largest island, either by force or through negotiation. For example, U.S. National Security Advisor Stephen Miller stated that Greenland should belong to the United States and that “nobody is going to fight the United States” over it.

However, this week, in his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Donald Trump insisted that he wants to “acquire Greenland, including rights, titles, and ownership.” But, in a shift in rhetoric, he stated that he would not use force to achieve this.

Whether due to its mineral wealth or its strategic position on Arctic trade routes, in recent weeks the US government has prioritized statements regarding the purchase of the island, weakening its relationship with Europe in the process. And Greenlanders are not indifferent to this.

Greenland is an island of more than 2 million square kilometers, bisected by the Arctic Circle, with a population of fewer than 60,000. This is equivalent to fitting the entire population of a country the size of Mexico into its National Stadium. La Tercera interviewed five residents of the island to learn how Trump's threats have impacted one of the most isolated places on the planet.

Surrealism
Sara Næss, a student at the University of Greenland, commented that the island's characteristic tranquility remains present across much of the territory, but in more populated areas like Nuuk, the capital, tension is palpable in the streets. She noted that “the military and police presence has increased dramatically. Also, journalists are everywhere. On the street, in supermarkets, restaurants, and some even showed up unannounced at businesses and institutions, overwhelming people.”

Mads Hyldahl, an international trade engineer, said something similar. “There have certainly been noticeable changes since Trump brought up the Greenland issue again. The recent escalation of the military presence has not gone unnoticed, and it is causing greater unease and discomfort for some.”

A different case is that of Aputsiaq Isaksen, a mining barge operator from the southern village of Nanortalik. He commented that Trump's annexation threats have meant "a very significant change in daily life and in our conversations with loved ones. But life goes on as usual for now, with no soldiers in sight."

"Yes, the conversation often revolves around 'what if?', and several families have started preparing. Other than that, everything seems more or less the same as always," added Lasse Nymand, a search and rescue helicopter pilot.

However, Isaksen added, "I can't help but think that the land I live on might not belong to the Inuit—the island's original inhabitants—but to others who want it. It's surreal."

"We depend on decisions made in the Oval Office, and we have this unsettling feeling of not knowing what tomorrow will bring," Hyldahl added. Greenland has a long history surrounding the debate over the country's independence. There is a strong Inuit nationalist sentiment among the population, which achieved self-governance in 2009. Locals also commented on their concerns about Washington's "free rein" attitude towards them.
Simon Lynge, a singer-songwriter from Alluitsoq—another village in the south of the island—said, “It’s painful and very disrespectful. It saddens and angers me deeply. We are strong, survivors, but also very kind and gentle people.”

“There’s a lot of anger,” he continued. Hyldahl added that they feel “dehumanized, diminished, sad, and voiceless.”

“The lack of respect from the United States really irritates me. They should stay away,” said Nymand, the helicopter pilot. “You feel small and disrespected. What if we were independent and not part of NATO?” wondered Isaksen, the barge operator.
Unpredictability and Loss
In the middle of this week, the Greenlandic government presented a guide to prepare the population in case of a crisis. Specifically, the pamphlet presented was an instruction manual on how to respond to “events that make the population particularly vulnerable” by preparing a five-day survival kit.

La Tercera spoke with locals about this. Hyldahl indicated that the plans of the Greenlandic population are varied. “There are many opinions among the people, from doing nothing to considering directly counterattacking as civilians,” he stated.

We, as a family, decided to stock up on essential items a few days ago. Due to the unpredictability of the current US president,” he continued.

“Yes, people are preparing,” Lynge affirmed. “Stockpiling fuel, food, and making plans. Some have cabins in the mountains to which they plan to escape. The government encouraged people to stock up on hunting rifles, ammunition, and fishing equipment. Although the weapons aren't for war, but for survival. In Greenland, everyone hunts,” the singer-songwriter added.

Unlike Hyldahl's family, Isaksen said, “We tell the children not to worry too much, to just live normally for now. No survival kits, no panic, for now.”

Nymand stated, “My family and I have talked about what we would do if the worst happened and the United States decided to annex us. Whether to leave the country or stay. That's a decision no one wants to have to make.”

In addition to the above, the population's fears are not only related to the violence of a foreign occupation, but also to the subsequent loss of the island's cultural and environmental identity. “We have seen how the U.S. administration treats Native Americans and their sacred territories. Integrating into the United States would put our culture and way of life at risk,” Hyldahl argued.
Næss echoed this sentiment. “Let’s look at how they treat Native Americans to understand the extent to which the U.S. disregards Indigenous peoples and their rights. They represent everything that Greenland does not. Here, there is free healthcare, schools, LGBTQIA+ rights, freedom of expression, and community,” she noted.

Isaksen commented on this, saying, “I don’t think we would lose our language—Kalaallisut—but we would lose our way of life, the pristine wilderness, the wildlife, and our hunting traditions.”

Similarly, Nymand maintained, “My greatest fear is losing our connection to nature, our language, and our culture. We are deeply connected to the land, and history shows us that the United States has not treated Indigenous peoples very well. They exploit and pollute them.”

“It would be like cutting off a runner’s leg, taking the forest away from a South American Indigenous tribe, or taking the ocean away from a whale,” she later compared.

“Everything that makes us Greenlanders might be lost,” Isaksen speculated.

Finally, Hyldahl commented that “our greatest desire is to become a sovereign state capable of taking care of itself. We may not be sovereign, but we have achieved self-government and we speak for ourselves in our own affairs (…) I fear that all of that progress would be lost if the United States annexes us.”
