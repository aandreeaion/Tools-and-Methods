The pros and cons of covering sparsely populated Spain with solar panels, as proposed by Elon Musk
One of the major challenges is the intermittency of solar energy, since without large-scale storage systems, production does not always match demand.
The proposal to promote large solar plants in sparsely populated areas of Spain, championed by American magnate Elon Musk as an efficient solution to accelerate the energy transition, has reopened the debate on the renewable energy development model in the country. With one of the highest levels of solar radiation in Europe and vast expanses of sparsely populated territory, Spain appears as a strategic location for large-scale photovoltaic projects. However, the initiative is not without controversy.

In the midst of the race towards decarbonization and compliance with the European Union's climate goals, solar energy is emerging as a key component of the energy mix. The question is no longer whether to invest in it, but how and where to do so.

Economic and Energy Advantages
The main advantage of large solar plants in sparsely populated areas is the availability of land. Municipalities affected by the so-called "Empty Spain" have thousands of hectares of land not currently used for urban or industrial purposes, which facilitates the implementation of large-scale projects without having to compete with residential land.

Furthermore, these types of installations allow for maximizing electricity production thanks to economies of scale and optimal solar exposure. In energy terms, they would represent a decisive step towards reducing dependence on fossil fuels and energy imports, strengthening the security of the national electricity system.

From an economic perspective, these projects can also generate local employment, especially during the construction phase, and provide income to municipalities through taxes and land leases. For some regions experiencing population decline, the arrival of private investment is seen as an opportunity to revitalize the economy.

Environmental Impact and Social Opposition
However, the benefits do not outweigh the risks. One of the main arguments against them is the environmental impact. Many of these depopulated areas harbor fragile ecosystems, wildlife corridors, or landscapes of high natural value. The massive occupation of land with solar panels can alter biodiversity and irreversibly transform the environment.

There is also concern about the landscape impact and the loss of other traditional land uses, such as extensive livestock farming or agriculture. In some cases, local groups complain that the economic benefits do not compensate for the transformation of the land nor are they distributed equitably among the population.

Added to this are the high costs of connecting to the electricity grid. Large solar plants are usually located far from the main consumption centers, which requires the construction of new electricity transmission infrastructure, with the consequent environmental and economic impact.

The challenge of balance
Another major challenge is the intermittency of solar energy. Without large-scale storage systems—such as batteries or green hydrogen—production does not always coincide with demand, requiring backup from other sources or additional investments.

In this context, experts and government bodies agree that the debate should not focus solely on the scale of the projects, but rather on their planning. The key lies in finding a balance between energy development, environmental protection, and social consensus.

Spain has a historic opportunity to lead the renewable energy transition in Europe. The challenge will be to do so without repeating past mistakes and ensuring that solar energy does not become a new source of conflict within the country.
