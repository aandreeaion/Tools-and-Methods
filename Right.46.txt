Meralco solar unit announces Leviste replacement in Board
MANILA — A renewable energy unit of Meralco has announced the replacement of SPNEC founder and Batangas Rep. Leandro Leviste as it reorganizes its Board of Directors.

Terra Solar Philippines Inc. (MTerra Solar), a subsidiary of Meralco PowerGen Corporation (MGEN), said Emmanuel Rubio, president and chief executive of MGEN, has been appointed to the board effective January 21. He succeeds Leandro Leviste, the founder of Solar Philippines, who has stepped down from his position.

MGen said the reorganization of MTerra Solar's board comes as it prepares to begin operations at its massive solar facility.

"This transition marks a natural progression for MTerra Solar as it approaches commissioning," Rubio said in a statement. He added that the new board structure would align strategic oversight more closely with "system integration and operational execution."
The leadership change comes at a critical juncture for MTerra Solaras, as it prepares for the commercial operation of its flagship project, which is touted as the world’s largest integrated solar and battery storage facility.

The project, which spans Nueva Ecija and Bulacan, aims to ramp up to 1,500 megawatts (MW) by August 2026. Once fully completed, it is expected to generate 3,500 MWp of solar power, complemented by a 4,500 MWh battery energy storage system, supplying clean energy to approximately 2.4 million households.

Leviste's departure coincides with increased regulatory scrutiny and a P24-billion-peso penalty imposed by the Department of Energy on Leviste’s original firm, Solar Philippines, for failing to deliver on previous energy commitments.

MTerra Solar and its parent, SP New Energy Corporation (SPNEC), have repeatedly clarified that they are separate entities from the Solar Philippines unit facing government fines. SPNEC recently applied to change its name to MGEN Renewable Energy Holdings, Inc. to consolidate Meralco's green energy assets.
