What the asbestos task force now needs to find out
Following alarming investigations by Greenpeace, the state of Burgenland wants to quickly clarify the potential health risks posed by asbestos-containing materials. Dedicated contact points have been established for the public.
How great is the danger posed by asbestos-containing materials? This is one of the most important questions that the task force established by the state is intended to examine.
As previously reported, four quarries in central and southern Burgenland were closed at the beginning of the year due to asbestos-contaminated material. At the end of last week, Greenpeace also raised the alarm: up to 50 percent asbestos was found in samples taken in three municipalities in southern Burgenland.
No need to panic. Governor Hans Peter Doskozil said on Monday that while these results are being taken very seriously, the public should not be alarmed. He added, addressing Greenpeace, that it is not enough to simply take rock samples and draw conclusions from the results. It is important to differentiate: what portion of the asbestos is bound and therefore not harmful to health, and what portion is released? As is well known, asbestos poses a danger when it is released into the air as dust, for example, through grinding, and thus enters the lungs.
Air quality is being investigated. Therefore, the task force – a seven-member team of experts led by environmental physician Hans-Peter Hutter and his deputy Hanns Moshammer from the Medical University of Vienna – will investigate the matter objectively and in accordance with standards. This will include measuring air quality at several locations – including where Greenpeace has taken samples.
Initial results expected in a month. According to sworn and court-certified expert Michael Kochberger, initial results should be available in a month, allowing for preliminary conclusions. However, a single measurement run will not suffice. Strict adherence to the standards system is crucial to obtaining reliable results. Kochberger stated that he could not comment on the Greenpeace sampling, as he was not familiar with the sampling protocol.
Samples will be taken again from the quarries. The affected quarries will also be sampled again – this time with an eye toward improved measurement technology and the involvement of experts, according to Provincial Councillor Heinrich Dorner. He emphasized, however, that there is currently no inherent health risk.
Are other federal states also affected? If any limits are exceeded, solutions will be offered jointly with the task force, Doskozil explained. He rejected Greenpeace's accusation that the authorities should have closed the quarries earlier. Burgenland was the only federal state to react, even though other quarries with similar geogenic inclusions exist. Had the decision been based solely on the measurements taken by the labor inspectorate in the quarries, no closures would have occurred, Doskozil stated. Two of the four quarries are owned by Styria.
Legal issues: Both the governor and his deputy, Anja Haider-Wallner, noted that there is currently no clear legal framework specifying when action must be taken. Federal authorities and ministries are responsible in this matter.
Haider-Wallner promised full transparency to the public. A hotline for inquiries from the public will be available starting Tuesday, and   the most important questions will also be answered online .
Greenpeace has once again warned of the dangers of asbestos , demanding closures . The findings so far are just the tip of the iceberg. The affected material has been spread over a wide area. Fibers from brittle asbestos fragments are released into the air even with the slightest disturbance. "We continue to demand that affected areas be closed off immediately to protect the public. The more asbestos debris is left lying exposed in affected areas, the more carcinogenic asbestos fibers can be released into the air," said Stefan Stadler of Greenpeace.
ÖVP parliamentary group leader Bernd Strobl described the task force as a step in the right direction. However, he added that there were still open questions regarding the authorities' inspections: "Asbestos contamination doesn't suddenly appear overnight," Strobl stated.
