Storm Chandra flood warnings map shows where 'danger to life' risk looms over Britain
Storm Chandra is set to bring severe flooding and travel disruption today amid weather warnings for rain and snow - with several flood warnings in place
Storm Chandra is set to bring severe flooding and significant travel chaos to parts of the country today.
Multiple weather warnings have been issued, including several for rain, with heavy downpours forecast across the Southwest and Northwest of England at various times. Snowfall is also expected, with the most substantial accumulations predicted across Scotland and northern England. The Environment Agency has issued alerts to Britons about potential flooding, warning that roads will become hazardous due to standing water. The RAC has urged motorists to "slow down and stay alert" throughout the day.
Properties and commercial premises are at risk of flooding, which could result in structural damage. The Met Office has also cautioned that landslides may occur in vulnerable areas.

Currently, 67 flood warnings are active in England, with an additional two in Scotland. Most of these concern waterways throughout the Southwest of England, including numerous alerts for the Dorset National Landscape and several across Devon.
According to the Met Office website: "Storm Chandra will bring persistent rain, heavy at times, later Monday and overnight before steadily clearing northeastwards on Tuesday morning. 30-50 mm rainfall is likely widely, with 60-80 mm across some higher ground, especially south Dartmoor.
Falling on saturated ground, this is likely to lead to flooding and disruption, particularly on Tuesday morning. Strong southeasterly winds are also expected."
The Met Office has warned of 60-70mph gusts affecting eastern Northern Ireland, with potential 75mph gusts in coastal areas, noting that "easterly winds of this strength are unusual and are likely to be impactful". Despite this, flooding continues to be the main worry across numerous regions, with the Express providing a comprehensive overview of the flood risks.
