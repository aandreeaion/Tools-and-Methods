How Spanish agriculture is changing crops due to climate change: less cotton and more olive groves and vegetables

Spanish agriculture is changing crops due to climate change, accelerating a historic transformation
The last decade confirms a historic shift: industrial crops and cereals are declining while olive groves, lettuce and strawberries are gaining ground.

From cotton and beets to olive groves and lettuce: the new agricultural landscape
The Spanish countryside, always attentive to the weather and the effects of climate change , has registered a transformation in the last decade, with a downward evolution in the area of ​​crops such as sugar beet, tobacco, cotton or sunflower and a rebound in olive groves, lettuce or strawberries.

Spanish agriculture faces a decisive decade for its survival
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAPA) has just published the provisional data of the Survey on Crop Areas and Yields (Esyrce) 2025 .

Among the conclusions, it was found that agricultural land has barely changed compared to 2024 and remains at 16.70 million hectares, only 0.03% less.

Of that area, 11.12 million is arable land where cereals, legumes, tubers, rice, beets or tobacco, among other crops, are produced; 5.42 million are home to woody crops such as olive groves, vineyards, fruit trees and citrus fruits, and the remaining 150,191 hectares are family orchards and other uses.

Esyrce , in its comparison between the surface area registered in 2015 and in 2025, notes important changes, such as that the olive grove (2.87 million hectares last year) has increased by 5%, while the vineyard (905,099) has decreased by almost the same proportion, 5.1% in particular.

Other woody crops, such as fruit trees (1.28 million hectares), increased their area by 6.2% in a decade, while citrus fruits decreased by 1.6% (298,929); tomatoes for industry (26,240) fell by 12.5% ​​but traditional vegetable cultivation increased by 17.2% (14,530).

Droughts, heat and profitability: the forces driving change
The largest percentage increases correspond to lettuce, which boosts its extension by 70.9% in a decade (7,554 ha), broccoli (9,900 ha, +38.3%), green peas (9,900 ha, +32.6%), strawberries (12,614 ha, +30.3%) and chickpeas (57,439 ha, +26.7%).

Among industrial crops, the most significant decline was in cotton cultivation, which fell by 24.8%; followed by sugar beet, which decreased by 17.4%; tobacco decreased by 15.0% and sunflower by 8.6%; while safflower, an oilseed similar to sunflower, rose by 60.1% to 22,213 hectares.

Cereals are declining while vegetables are gaining prominence
Currently, Spain has 5.74 million hectares of cereal grain , which is 4.7% less than a decade ago.

Six-row barley (98,017 ha, -43.5%) and durum wheat (283,915 ha, -25.4%) registered a significant drop, while soft wheat (1.70 million ha) remained stable.

 The most cultivated is two-row barley, which has 2.31 million hectares of cultivation despite a 6.1% decrease in its area.

Meanwhile, rice has gained 6.5% in area over the last ten years (100,335 hectares), while for corn it has decreased by 10% (299,072); oat cultivation has increased by 6.3% (456,186) and rye cultivation has decreased by 10.6% (100,335).

On the other hand, the survey places Spain's forest area at 19.54 million hectares and its meadows and pastures at 8.42 million.
