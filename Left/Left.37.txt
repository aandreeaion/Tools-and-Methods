The storm intensifies this Wednesday with a drop in temperature, rain, snow and strong gusts of wind
A sharp drop in temperature is expected, especially in the northern half, with temperatures falling by 4 to 6 degrees compared to the previous day.

The storm affecting almost all of Spain will intensify this Wednesday, with the formation of a low-pressure system that will cross the Peninsula from west to east, generating a marked drop in temperature , widespread precipitation, and snowfall in the mountains and large areas of the northern plateau, according to the forecast from the State Meteorological Agency (Aemet). In addition, strong winds will continue to blow across much of the country 

"This weather system will cause a sharp drop in temperature, especially in the northern half of the country , with temperatures falling by 4 to 6 degrees Celsius compared to the previous day,” the state weather agency explained in a press release, while urging people to remain vigilant and monitor the evolving weather situation. “Small variations in its trajectory could significantly alter the distribution and intensity of precipitation and snowfall,” they warned. 

Maximum temperatures will decrease in the Balearic Islands and the northeastern half of the Iberian Peninsula, with notable drops in the Ebro Valley and surrounding areas. They will only rise in the Alboran Sea and the southwest quadrant, with little change elsewhere. Minimum temperatures will decrease in the northeastern third of the peninsula, the rest of the Levante coast, and the Balearic Islands. Light frosts are expected in the mountains of the northern half of the peninsula and parts of the northern plateau, with moderate to locally severe frosts in the Pyrenees, according to Aemet (the Spanish State Meteorological Agency). 

Widespread precipitation and snow
Wednesday will be a cloudy day with widespread rain , although the heaviest accumulations are expected in southern Galicia, the mountains of the Atlantic coast, and especially in the Alboran Sea and the southern mountain ranges of the Iberian Peninsula, where persistent and locally heavy rain is forecast. Warnings are in place for Andalusia and Castilla-La Mancha.

The snow level will drop sharply , settling between 800 and 1000 meters in the northern third of the country during the middle of the day. Significant snowfall is expected in all mountainous areas of the northern half of the Iberian Peninsula, with accumulations that could exceed 10-15 centimeters in 24 hours above 1200 meters, although light accumulations of less than 5 centimeters are possible in areas of the northern plateau. 

Aemet has activated warnings for snowfall in several communities: Aragon, Castilla y León, Castilla-La Mancha, Catalonia, Extremadura, Galicia, Community of Madrid, Navarre and La Rioja

Wind and rough seas are also expected across almost the entire country. Very strong gusts are forecast again across large areas, particularly intense on the leeward side of the mountain ranges in the southern half. The strongest gusts are expected in the southeast of the Iberian Peninsula and, above all, in the Alboran Sea, where they will exceed 100 kilometers per hour.
