For the first time in a decade, coal-fired electricity generation in China falls: renewable energy drives a historic shift by 2025

China ended 2025 with a statistical shift that hadn't appeared in its electricity mix for years (thermal generation, based mainly on coal , fell for the first time in 10 years). According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), thermal electricity fell by 1% for the year as a whole to 6.29 trillion kWh, with a more pronounced year-on-year drop in December (3.2%).

The important detail is the “how.” Demand didn't slow down (it became electrified). The National Energy Administration (NEA) reported that total electricity consumption surpassed the 10 trillion kWh mark for the first time, reaching 10.3682 trillion kWh , a 5.0% increase. This growth was driven primarily by services and uses linked to the digital economy and the electric vehicle value chain.

The key was that renewable and non-fossil fuel growth covered a significant portion of the increased demand without the need to "accelerate" coal production. According to NBS data (which includes production from industrial companies above a certain revenue threshold), total generation reached 9.7159 trillion kWh (up 2.2%). Within this context, hydroelectric generation increased by 2025 (2.8%), while nuclear generation grew even more significantly (7.7%).

There is another, less comfortable interpretation that coexists with the positive data. The fact that thermal electricity is declining does not mean that China is abruptly "abandoning" coal (in fact, it is mentioned that coal production remained at record levels). The shift is more akin to a structural change in the curve (more renewables entering the grid and a moderation of demand growth) than a sudden withdrawal of the fuel.

According to analysts quoted by Reuters , record renewable energy development “has reduced demand for coal,” coupled with slower demand growth than in 2024, and this trend “is difficult to reverse.” This aligns with the 2026 scenario, where renewable energy expansion is expected to remain strong and electricity consumption is projected to maintain similar growth (around 5%).
