The violent ice storm in the United States originated from a distortion of the polar vortex.
While Americans are freezing, Donald Trump is making light of climate change, and he's wrong to do so.

“WHAT HAPPENED TO CLIMATE CHANGE?” With this rhetorical question addressed to “environmental insurgents , ” Donald Trump used the icy storm raging in the United States as a pretext to once again express his climate denialism on Monday, January 26. But the billionaire president is wrong: climate change is indeed causing significant damage, and scientists are already questioning his role in this storm, which has caused the deaths of at least eleven people and created widespread chaos.

Considered by some meteorologists to be one of the worst winter episodes in recent decades in the United States, with freezing temperatures - down to -45 degrees in the Northern Great Plains - and impressive snow accumulations, this storm is linked to a deformation of the polar vortex.

To fully understand the phenomenon unfolding across the Atlantic, scientists suggest looking more than 30 km above the Earth's surface, where the famous "Northern Hemisphere Stratospheric Polar Vortex" is located . This is a pocket of very cold air that rotates in a circle above the North Pole, explains the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ). Normally, this large icy vortex remains stable, but it can become distorted due to atmospheric disturbances. This is what happened this winter.

A wave of polar air moving south
These disturbances had repercussions in the lower layers of the atmosphere, influencing the jet stream, as you can see in the diagram below . The jet stream is a boundary of strong winds that plays a key role in trapping cold air around the pole. When the jet stream is strong and straight, it keeps the cold air at the pole. But when it weakens, it begins to meander. As it lost strength this winter, the jet stream began to form large meanders, known as waves, toward the south. One of these waves caused polar air to plunge straight toward the United States.

As it moved down towards the American continent, this cold air came into contact with warm, humid air from the Gulf of Mexico. This clash led to the extreme weather conditions that Americans are experiencing today: snowfall, high winds, freezing rain, and potentially deadly temperatures.

These disturbances of the polar vortex are becoming increasingly frequent, and this could be linked to the rapid warming of the Arctic, explain two climatologists in The Conversation . In this regard, Judah Cohen, a climate researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, co-authored a 2025 study published in the prestigious journal Science demonstrating that the melting of Arctic ice releases more heat and moisture into the atmosphere, which disrupts wind patterns and promotes undulations in the jet stream.

Warm oceans that fuel storms
With global warming, "the frequency of weak polar vortices is increasing, while strong or circular polar vortices are becoming less frequent," summarizes Judah Cohen, quoted by the New York Times . However, not all researchers agree on the reasons for the distortion of the vortices; many suggest that natural variability plays a major role in their disruption.

Furthermore, another consequence of climate change may have played a role in the occurrence of this major storm in the United States: ocean warming. By absorbing excess heat due to global warming, "the ocean stores excess energy, which 'accelerates' the water cycle," explained oceanographer Carole Saout-Grit in a 2024 interview with HuffPost . This has a cascading effect: the evaporation process is amplified, the warming atmosphere stores more moisture, and this promotes the occurrence of extreme weather events, such as more violent storms.

From this reasoning, we can deduce that the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico, particularly warm this year, have very likely fueled the warm air mass and strengthened the current storm.

The role of climate change in the occurrence of extreme weather events remains a subject of much debate. The problem is that Donald Trump has drastically cut funding to numerous American scientific institutions and announced the dismantling of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, a cornerstone of global climate research . Environmental activists can therefore respond to the American president that "global warming is real," but that he is doing everything he can to ignore and deny it.
