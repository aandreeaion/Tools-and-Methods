Boulet inherits the Economy portfolio, Charette takes over the Environment portfolio

Thus, Jean Boulet will assume, in addition to his responsibilities as Minister of Labour, the functions of Minister of Economy, Innovation and Energy.  

For his part, Benoit Charette takes over the Ministry of the Environment, the Fight Against Climate Change, Wildlife and Parks, while retaining responsibility for Infrastructure.

“Today, I am once again entrusted with the responsibility for the Environment file. […] It is a very important file and I thank François Legault for the trust he places in me,” Mr. Charette reacted on X.  

These changes, which were announced Monday afternoon at the end of a special cabinet meeting, were necessary because of the leadership race in the Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ).

According to the rules of the race, candidates to succeed Mr. Legault must relinquish, at least temporarily, their ministerial responsibilities.

This is the case for Christine Fréchette, who was Minister of Economy and Energy, and Bernard Drainville, who held the Environment portfolio. Both launched their campaigns at the end of the week.

"At the start of this CAQ leadership race, I wish good luck to the two very high-quality candidates who have begun their campaigns," Mr. Legault said on his social media on Monday.

A leadership race is a demanding exercise, both personally and politically. It's even more so when you become Premier of Quebec. Christine and Bernard, I wish you a campaign worthy of your talents, conducted with rigor and integrity, in the best interests of Quebecers!

 François Legault

François Legault announced his resignation on January 14, saying he understood that Quebecers were thirsty for change.

He indicated that he would resign as soon as a replacement was chosen. The new leader of the CAQ, who will be the de facto premier of Quebec, will be elected on April 12.
