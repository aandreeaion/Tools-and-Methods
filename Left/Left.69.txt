Dangerous particulate matter far above the limit

Health hazard from particulate matter: In Dresden, the limit values ​​were significantly exceeded over the weekend. What's behind it and when a solution will come

Dresden is struggling with poor air quality. Over the weekend, the state capital, along with numerous other cities in Saxony, exceeded the particulate matter limits – in some cases significantly. However, the German Weather Service sees an improvement on the horizon.

The German Federal Environment Agency reported significant problems with particulate matter up to 2.5 micrometers in size (PM2.5). The limit of 25 micrograms per cubic meter of air was far exceeded in many places in Saxony – besides Dresden, also in Zwickau, Leipzig, Bautzen, Zittau and Görlitz.

Particles can penetrate deep into the respiratory tract.
On Saturday, average PM10 levels in several cities exceeded the limit of 50 micrograms per cubic meter of air, according to data from the State Office for Environment, Agriculture and Geology. The affected cities were Bautzen, Görlitz, Leipzig, Liebschützberg, and Niesky.

According to experts, the fine particles can penetrate deeper into the airways and cause lasting damage to the lungs.

Fine dust originates from exhaust fumes from heating and traffic.
The high-pressure weather system of the past few days has meant that air can no longer rise freely, causing pollutants to concentrate in the lower atmosphere, the German Weather Service explained in response to an inquiry. The particulate matter originates, for example, from exhaust fumes from heating and traffic.

According to meteorologists, however, relief is on the way. A large area of ​​precipitation is expected at the beginning of the week, bringing rain and snow. This will not only wash such pollutants out of the air, but will also remove the previous "atmospheric cap".
