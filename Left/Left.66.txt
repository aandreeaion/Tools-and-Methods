Denmark and Germany finally agree on the largest energy project in Danish history
Climate Minister Lars Aagaard states that this is not the end of energy cooperation with Germany.

After a long process, Germany and Denmark have finally joined hands on the largest energy project in Danish history - Energiø Bornholm.

A project that will build massive parks with offshore wind turbines south and southwest of Bornholm. 

This was just announced by the Minister of Climate, Energy and Utilities, Lars Aagaard (M), at the North Sea Summit in Hamburg.

Lars Aagaard tells DR News that they have agreed to share the cost of the project.

- I am obviously very happy and proud of that, he said. 

DR's climate analyst, Filip Knaack Kirkegaard, also emphasizes that it is a project that costs a lot of money. 

- We do not know the final price of the project, but it is not inconceivable that the total price will end up in the three-digit billions, because the wind turbines alone can easily cost 50-60 billion kroner, and on top of that comes the price of cables and the converter station on Bornholm, he says.

'A huge project'
Filip Knaack Kirkegaard also emphasizes how big a project it is, which is now closer to becoming a reality. 

- We are talking about a huge project, and the largest single project in Danish history. It is a type of decision that can be compared to the decision to build the gas network or invest in district heating. In other words, a decision that has great significance for energy policy in Denmark in the coming decades, he says. 

However, he reminds us that the states do not have to pay for the establishment of the energy island, but only provide a price guarantee for the electricity to the companies that choose to invest in the island - that is, a certain settlement price per kilowatt-hour of electricity that the turbines produce.

- This will mean that if energy prices become very low, the companies will be compensated by the Danish and German states, but if it turns out that wind energy can be sold very expensively, the states will instead get a share of the profit, says Filip Knaack Kirkegaard.

The EU has supported the project with almost five billion Danish kroner. 

It is expected that Energiø Bornholm will be able to supply electricity to around three million households in Denmark and Germany.

First, however, the agreement must be finally approved by the Danish Parliament, where the government, as is known, has a majority.
Satisfied minister: Not the end of German-Danish cooperation
It was a satisfied Lars Aagaard who spoke to DR News in Hamburg. Here is what he said: 

- It is a project that can give us very large amounts of green electricity, and it strengthens our security and can result in lower electricity prices on Zealand, he said and continued: 

- Yes, it comes with a price, but we have assessed that it is worth the money. 


- It gives us an opportunity to trade with Germany, and Denmark itself would never be able to accommodate such a large project as Energiø Bornholm. What the negotiations have been about is finding a fair distribution of the costs, says Lars Aagaard.

The government has previously floated the possibility of building more offshore wind farms in Danish waters, where the electricity goes to Germany. Is that something you have on the drawing board? 

- We will also work on that. We actually have a bill right now that needs to be approved in the next few months. So this is not the end of energy cooperation with Germany.
