Moscow records its worst snowfall in two centuries

(Moscow) Moscow was buried in January by the worst snowfall in two centuries, meteorologists from Moscow State University announced Thursday, blaming "deep and extensive cyclones" that passed over the region of the Russian capital.

As of January 29, Moscow had experienced snowfall equivalent to approximately 92 cm of precipitation, "the highest value in the last 203 years," the university noted on the social network VK. The temperature was also 1.5°C below the seasonal average, which for January stands at -6.2°C, according to the institution.

The “abnormally high” amount of snowfall is the result of “deep and extensive cyclones with an intensified atmospheric front passing over the Moscow region,” Moscow State University explained in its statement.

You have to go back to 1823 to find such intense snowfall in the Russian capital, with precipitation of around 122 cm at the time, the university adds, while warning that "observations made in such a distant past may not be entirely reliable".

The second record was recorded in January 2004 with 88.9 cm of rainfall.

 "In total, over two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), the capital received 27 cm, which is more than half of the monthly norm," Tatiana Pozdniakova, chief meteorologist of the specialized service Meteonovosti, stated on Telegram.

Snow reached more than 60 cm in height in the capital on Thursday and some streets were transformed into temporary storage areas to facilitate the clearing of other roads.
