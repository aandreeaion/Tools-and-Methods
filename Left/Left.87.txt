Cold waves in Spain are getting shorter due to climate change

Cold waves in Spain are becoming less frequent and lasting fewer days, according to a study by Meteoclimática (CREAF). Since 1976, their duration has decreased at a rate of 1.2 days per decade, and none have been recorded in the last two winters, an unprecedented event since climate records began

Cold waves in Spain are becoming shorter and less frequent
An analysis by Meteoclimatica reveals that cold waves have decreased in frequency and duration over the last 50 years, while episodes of extreme heat are increasing.

If no cold waves occur this winter, Spain will face a third consecutive year without one . This is an unprecedented situation since meteorological records began, according to climate analysts.

Despite occasional below-average temperatures in early 2026, authorities have not classified any episodes as a cold wave because the thresholds for duration, intensity, and geographical extent have not been met.

Cold waves are "becoming less frequent" in Spain and their duration has been reduced at a rate of 1.2 days per decade in the period 1976/2025, according to an analysis by Meteoclimatica, the journalistic project of the Center for Ecological Research and Forestry Applications ( CREAF ).

The report notes that only nine cold waves were recorded in the last ten years, compared to 14 in the previous decade. Furthermore, none were recorded in the last two winters, despite low temperatures on specific dates.

Should this winter not be recorded either, it would be the third consecutive one: "something unprecedented since records have been kept" according to Meteoclimatica.

What is considered a cold wave ?
Although thermometers have recorded some temperatures below the normal average for this time of year since the beginning of 2026, the State Meteorological Agency has not yet considered this year a cold wave due to the absence of "well-defined criteria of duration, intensity and territorial extent".

For this organization, the phenomenon implies at least 3 consecutive days with a minimum of 10% of its stations recording minimum temperatures below the 5th percentile of its historical series for January and February (1971/2000).

Meteoclimática acknowledges that the definition "is not universal" and that the World Meteorological Organization itself, for example, describes a cold wave as "the result of a very cold air mass extending over a wide area." But even so, "the fact is that cold waves in Spain have decreased" over the last 50 years.

The data indicates that these events are more frequent in the east and northeast of the Iberian Peninsula, and Huesca (with 46 recorded) and Tarragona (with 41) are the provinces with the most cold episodes in the historical record. Although it is not usually the coldest area, "it is exposed to the entry of continental air masses that cause these types of events."

At the opposite end are Pontevedra, Vizcaya, Lugo and La Coruña, which recorded fewer than 20 episodes in fifty years, "largely" due to the influence of a more temperate climate.

A brief cold spell is not a cold wave
The analysis highlights the existence of days of intense cold in the winter of 2024/2025, with temperatures as low as -11°C in Molina de Aragón (Guadalajara). However, "neither the intensity, nor the duration, nor the extent were sufficient" to declare the cold wave as such.

The last cold wave recorded on the Iberian Peninsula was between February 28 and March 2, 2023, with a climate anomaly of -1.2°C, affecting 13 provinces. In comparison, the cold wave that occurred between February 8 and 18, 1983, had an anomaly of -4.8°C and impacted 44 provinces.

According to Meteoclimática, this reduction in cold weather contrasts sharply with the decade-long series of summer heat waves . These have occurred across the Iberian Peninsula every year since 2015, with a progressive increase in intensity and duration.

In eight of the last ten years, heat waves exceeded 15 days in duration, with a maximum of 41 days in 2022.

What can be expected in the coming decades in terms of cold waves in Spain?
The study predicts that the frequency of cold waves will continue to decrease " as a consequence of climate change, " which is particularly affecting their intensity. While they "will not disappear until at least 2050," the most affected areas will be the southern Pyrenees, the southern half of the Mediterranean coast, and the Balearic Islands.

In any case, "climate change can cause phenomena like Storm Filomena to be intensified by increased humidity in the environment " if the surface temperature is low enough, he adds.

Cold waves have decreased across Spain over the last five decades, becoming more frequent in the eastern and northeastern areas exposed to continental air masses . Meanwhile, the Atlantic provinces experience far fewer events.

This reduction contrasts with the persistent and intense summer heat waves since 2015. This trend is expected to continue as climate change weakens cold extremes without eliminating them by 2050.
