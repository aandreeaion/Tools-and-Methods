"America's best idea"
How US national parks are suffering under Trump
US national parks are feeling the effects of last year's massive budget cuts. Price increases should be generating more revenue than ever before. But nature is being crushed under the uncontrolled throngs of visitors.

Pulitzer Prize-winning environmentalist Wallace Stegner once described US national parks as "America's best idea." This reputation has spread over decades, attracting not only some 300 million domestic visitors annually, but also millions of international tourists. Impressive hikes, educational programs, and ranger-led tours in the parks—and visitors are always left in awe of rock formations, waterfalls, forests, wildlife, or geysers, unable to believe how beautiful this earth is.

Since 2017, this wonder has been available for the bargain price of $80 per year, regardless of origin. That's over now; the Trump administration is raising prices for tourists. Since January 2026, foreign tourists have been paying $250 plus a $100 fee per person to enter the eleven most popular parks, including Yosemite, Yellowstone, the Everglades, and the Rocky Mountains. The price for domestic tourists remains unchanged. So, here too, it's America first!

More money in the coffers – theoretically

The increased prices are intended to compensate for the government funding cuts. Using Yellowstone as an example, the entrance fees from the 660,000 international visitors per year could generate around $66 million in revenue – provided they continue to come, according to Forbes magazine. Statistics on visitor numbers for 2026 are not yet available.

This would quadruple the park's total revenue from all entrance fees. “While we agree that the National Park Service urgently needs more resources, it is questionable whether this should come at the expense of international visitors, who are a major economic driver for some of our national parks and the surrounding regional economies,” said Bill Wade, executive director of the Association of National Park Rangers, in an official statement. He added that it is also problematic that many rangers are now occupied with time-consuming ID checks instead of attending to their actual duties.

Layoffs hit national parks hard

There should be enough money available to continue funding the numerous employees, but rangers and visitors are currently seeing no such benefit. Trump scrapped the extensive funding program to preserve protected natural areas in the fall of 2025. The government shutdown has further impacted park employees. During the shutdown, 64 percent of all employees were furloughed; currently, there are still about 25 percent fewer staff, according to the National Parks Conservation Association, a non-profit organization dedicated to protecting the parks and their employees. Even before that, in February, around 4,400 employees of the National Parks and National Forests lost their jobs, and about 2,400 more were forced into early retirement.

The consequences are severe, especially for nature. Visitor centers, service facilities, and restrooms remain closed, but the parks themselves are open, as they were during the shutdown in October 2025, when no employees were paid. Reports of vandalism and accidents are increasing, as are reports of mountains of trash in the parks. There is a shortage of rangers to enforce the rules for protecting nature and of personnel to monitor visitors and warn them of dangers. In many places, there are no longer any checks at the park entrances, so travelers can often drive in without paying.

The New York Times reports chaotic conditions in Yosemite National Park in California. Cars are parked off-site in meadows and on trails, and hikers are ignoring the marked trails, forging their own path through the wilderness. Many climb the extremely steep and dangerous path to the top of Half Dome without the required permit, and base jumpers hurl themselves from the granite cliffs, which is strictly prohibited. In many places, the parks are degenerating from recreational areas into amusement parks.

Instead of nature, Trump adorns the pass

But that's not the only visible consequence. The annual pass, a simple plastic card, previously featured a nature photograph from one of the parks, chosen in an annual photo contest. For 2026, it was supposed to be a photo of Glacier National Park, but the Department of the Interior changed its mind without comment after the official selection. Instead of flora or fauna, a grim-faced Donald Trump now adorns the annual pass next to a drawing of the first president, George Washington. Some cynics claim this is a deliberate attempt to change the policy.
