The heat absorbed by the oceans in 2025 is equivalent to the energy of 12 Hiroshima bombs.
A new scientific analysis has warned of the largest increase in ocean heat since 1960 and its direct link to extreme weather events in different regions of the planet.
The world's oceans reached their highest level of heat in 2025 since modern measurements began in the 1960s. A scientific study published on January 9 in the journal Advances in Atmospheric Science indicated that ocean waters absorbed an additional 23 zettajoules of thermal energy during that year, a figure far exceeding the 16 zettajoules measured in 2024.
This result marked the ninth consecutive year of record-breaking temperatures, constituting the longest streak of continuous increase in ocean heat content ever observed. The research was conducted by an international consortium of more than 50 scientists who have been systematically monitoring the evolution of heat stored in the oceans since 2018.
According to the analysis, the oceans play a central role in the global climate system. More than 90% of the excess heat generated by the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere ended up being absorbed by the waters, which function as the planet's main heat reservoir.
A magnitude difficult to imagine
To illustrate the impact, the authors used comparisons. A zettajoule is equivalent to a sextillion joules, the physical unit that measures work or energy. The increase observed in 2025 represented, in energy terms, the equivalent of about 12 atomic bombs like the one dropped on Hiroshima releasing their energy directly into the oceans.
Other estimates indicated that this amount of heat would be enough to boil approximately 2 billion Olympic-sized swimming pools, each with a volume of 2,500 m³. It would also be enough to cover more than 200 times the annual electricity consumption of the entire world population.
Cooler Surfaces, Warmer Depths
Although average sea surface temperatures in 2025 were slightly lower than those recorded in 2024, considered the warmest year in recent history, this did not imply any relief from global warming.
Natural phenomena such as El Niño and La Niña influenced the redistribution of heat. The strong El Niño event in 2024 raised surface temperatures, while a weak La Niña event toward the end of 2025 facilitated greater heat transfer to the deep ocean.
Experts warned that measurements based solely on surface temperature do not reflect the full extent of the phenomenon. The total ocean heat content, which includes deep waters, is a more robust indicator of long-term global warming.
Persistent Consequences
Ocean warming has both direct and indirect impacts. Higher temperatures fuel marine heat waves, affect ecosystems, alter atmospheric circulation, and modify global rainfall patterns. A warmer ocean also contributes more energy to intense tropical storms and extreme precipitation events.
The study noted that the results provide direct evidence of a climate system out of thermal equilibrium, which continues to accumulate heat. By 2025, the ocean regions with the highest recorded heat levels included the Tropical and South Atlantic, the Mediterranean Sea, the North Indian Ocean, and the Southern Ocean.
The researchers emphasized that this heat does not dissipate quickly. The process of warming the deep ocean took approximately 100 years, and even if the use of fossil fuels were to cease immediately, it would take centuries for that energy to be fully redistributed.
The 2025 record was not just a statistic. It reflected the persistence of a global warming process whose effects are already being felt and will continue to influence the planet's climate for generations.
