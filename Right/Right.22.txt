Ice storm knocks out power to a million customers across South as dangerous cold sets in
The hardest-hit states include Tennessee, Mississippi, and Louisiana, with significant outages also in Texas, Kentucky, and Georgia.
Each morning this week, Keith Avery, CEO of Newberry Electric Cooperative, arrives at his office and switches on The Weather Channel. He then begins making phone calls, coordinating crews and equipment to address potential outages if a predicted ice storm devastates power infrastructure throughout South Carolina.
Avery has managed disasters previously. Almost all of his 14,000 customers experienced power loss when Hurricane Helene's remnants swept through in 2024.
However, the incoming ice storm concerns him even more because ice-laden trees and power lines can continue collapsing well after the storm has moved on, leaving people without heat. 
"I hate ice storms," Avery said. "They are worse than hurricanes."
Authorities throughout the eastern two-thirds of the U.S. have been raising concerns about the potential for freezing rain to cause widespread damage to power infrastructure. In the South particularly, losing electricity doesn't simply mean the lights going out. It means losing heat.
That's because a majority of homes are heated by electricity in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Ice storms, Avery said, are particularly devastating because of what occurs afterward: Crews face difficulties reaching damaged lines on ice-covered roads; cold, wet conditions exhaust workers; and issues can persist for days as ice-covered branches keep breaking. "You get a power line back up and energized, and just as you leave, you hear a loud crack and boom, there's a tree limb crashing through what you just repaired," Avery said.
Texas faced its nightmare scenario in 2021, when Winter Storm Uri's frigid conditions devastated the state's electrical grid for five days and resulted in 246 storm-related fatalities, according to the Texas Department of Health Services.
