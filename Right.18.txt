SKIING IN THE CITY
New York in a winter storm: Emergency and snow joy
New York, like numerous other US states, is battling the massive winter storm that has already claimed its first victims. While thousands of flights have been canceled and public transportation is disrupted, some New Yorkers have also found enjoyment in the snow.
More than half of the US population is struggling with the current extreme winter weather – according to authorities, that's nearly 190 million people. A state of emergency has already been declared in at least 20 states – including New York and New Jersey – and the National Weather Service has warned of numerous dangers associated with the cold and the enormous amounts of snow.
Defying the Winter Storm
In New York, too, residents were urged to stay home – but many didn't want to miss out on the centimeters of snow. Although officials proudly emphasized that storm preparations had paid off and that subways and buses were largely running as usual—albeit on a weekend schedule on Monday—some people couldn't resist strapping on their (cross-country) skis in places like Times Square, Central Park, or on the Williamsburg Bridge.
Snowball fights with unusually large numbers of participants took place in some locations, and in Central Park, it wasn't just children who enjoyed sledding or small ski races. More than 25 centimeters of fresh snow were measured in Brooklyn on Sunday afternoon local time.
Mayor Mamdani: "No job is too small."
New York's airports reported more than 2,700 canceled flights, and LaGuardia Airport is closed until further notice. Schools will also remain closed on Monday, with classes being held online. Mayor Zohran Mamdani was spotted digging a snow-covered car. According to CBS, he commented, "No task too big and no job too small."
For those for whom the snow and cold are not a welcome event, provisions have been made: According to NBC News, warming centers will be opened in all five boroughs of New York City where residents can stay warm.
