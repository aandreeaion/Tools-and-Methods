Study: An era of extreme weather has begun in the Arctic
A new era has begun in the Arctic, where previously rare weather extremes have become frequent and widespread. This is directly affecting the flora, fauna and inhabitants there, scientists write in a new study .

In a study published in the journal Science Advances , scientists note that while extreme weather events in the Arctic used to occur episodically, they have now become a regular part of life in the region. For example, the region is plagued by short-term heat waves, droughts and winter rains. These changes directly affect local flora, fauna and residents, reports Science Alert . 

According to Gareth Phoenix, an ecologist at the University of Sheffield, the situation is serious: "Our research shows that the frequency of extreme weather events in the Arctic has increased dramatically." Phoenix explained that about a third of the region has only recently begun to experience such events, suggesting the beginning of a new era. However, the plants and animals of the Arctic are not ready for the new conditions.

Hotspots 

For their study, the team analyzed more than 70 years of data, focusing on short-term weather events that are often not reflected in monthly averages. They found that over the past 30 years, extreme weather events have spread to areas where scientists had not previously observed them. This was particularly evident in central Siberia, western Scandinavia, and the coast of Greenland.

One of the most serious changes, scientists say, is rain falling on snow. Rain caused by a warming climate forms a crust of ice on the ground, making food unavailable to animals. This has a severe impact on reindeer, for example, who can no longer eat lichen.

Experts refer to such processes as the so-called Arctic browning. The weather extremes described in the study are the main causes of the loss of vegetation cover. According to Miska Luoto, a geoscientist at the University of Helsinki, Arctic ecosystems are increasingly exposed to conditions that have never occurred there before. She believes that the changes could have far-reaching consequences for northern nature.

Impact on the entire planet

Juha Aalto, a climate scientist at the Finnish Meteorological Institute, pointed out that seasonal changes, including the length of the growing season and snow conditions, are key to the region's ecosystem. These factors determine the survival chances of Nordic species.

In addition to local species, the changes threaten the entire planet's climate. Melting tundra permafrost and loss of sea ice are disrupting the Arctic's carbon cycle, which could further accelerate global warming. Scientists plan to continue collecting more detailed data to understand the depth and scope of what is happening. This study is yet another confirmation that the Arctic is warming significantly faster than the rest of the world.
