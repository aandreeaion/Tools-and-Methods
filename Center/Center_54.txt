Lawmakers fault firm over alleged unauthorised logging in C’River forest
Lawmakers in the Cross River State House of Assembly have faulted alleged unauthorised entry into the Ekuri community forest in Akamkpa Local Government Area, amid claims of forest destruction and intimidation of residents.
In the last few months, there has been tension between the investor and the community, leading to arrests and detentions.

The Assembly summoned the company,  Ezemac International Ltd, and Ekuri community stakeholders following petitions and reports of altercations, with the community accusing Ezemac of deploying heavy machinery under military protection to log their forest without consent.
Speaking during the hearing, Egbe Egbe Abeng (Obubra II), condemned the company’s alleged use of bulldozers in a community forest and described the reported payment of N1 million for a year’s operation as exploitative.

He urged Ezemac to stop using security agencies to intimidate Ekuri residents.
Similarly, Linus Etim (Akamkpa II) said the Assembly would fully support the community, insisting it had the right to demand Ezemac’s exit if agreements were breached.

He said any alleged deal had expired, warned against military intimidation, and stressed the need for fair negotiation with host communities.

Another lawmaker, Okon Owuna (Akamkpa I) said documents presented showed Ezemac was permitted to operate in government forest reserves, not community forests.
He maintained that logging in Ekuri’s community forest without proper consent was unlawful and unsustainable, especially with the use of bulldozers.

Representing the Managing Director of Ezemac, Mr. Steven Asuwac admitted the firm encroached into Ekuri forest in 2023 while operating in Agoi Ekpo, adding that the company apologised and paid N5 million and a cow to appease the community.

He said Ezemac later registered with the community timber association in 2025, employed three locals, denied using bulldozers for logging, and said the machines were only for road construction.
Chairman of the State Forestry Commission, Dr. George Oben-Etchi, said Ezemac held a valid permit to operate in government reserves and was not running an illegal business under state law.

However, he noted that Ekuri forest is a community forest, requiring both commission approval and community negotiation, adding that the collection of fees implied an existing transaction.

Akamkpa LGA Chairman, Felix Akposi, appealed for calm, saying evidence of transactions suggested the issue was not illegal logging but disagreements over compliance, particularly for the current year.

Ruling, Chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture and Natural Resources, Bette Obi, faulted the Forestry Commission for weak oversight, noting discrepancies in records of timber logged.

He directed the commission to return for further engagement, asked Ezemac to withdraw police cases and meet with the community, and urged Ekuri leaders to submit a unified position.

He stressed that due process must be followed to protect both community rights and state revenue.
