Researchers discover factor that causes glaciers in Greenland to melt faster
Researchers are sounding the alarm: Greenland's ice sheet is losing billions of tons of ice every year. Rain plays a crucial role in this process.

Nuuk – Researchers are observing from the air how icebergs the size of office buildings drift through Greenland's fjords, and how cracks are tearing through the permafrost . "I thought we were flying low over the waves of a fjord before I realized that what I took for floating shards of ice were actually icebergs the size of office buildings," glaciologist Tom Chudley describes his impressions in the journal The Conversation . These observations send shivers down the spines of scientists, because Greenland is increasingly becoming key to understanding the global climate, while its exploration is at stake.
The Greenland ice sheet loses around 270 billion tons of ice annually, according to a study by the European Geoscience Union . However, the causes of the ice melt in Greenland are more complex than previously thought. German researchers at the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre in Kiel have discovered a previously underestimated factor: rain accelerates the ice melt.

“Rainy weather is becoming increasingly frequent in parts of the Greenland ice sheet, leading to short-term melting events even in winter,” explains Dr. Marilena Oltmanns from the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel. The rain carries heat across the glaciers and can, as a consequence, even double the melting. When the rain freezes on the snow, the surface darkens, which accelerates warming by the sun.

“The main problem is grasping the dimensions,” Chudley emphasizes. His research shows that the Greenland ice sheet is not just cracking, but literally disintegrating . Cracks grow rapidly and channel meltwater deep into the interior of the ice, causing the ice sheet to slide into the sea at an accelerated rate.

Greenland is indispensable for climate research. Its ice sheet, up to three kilometers thick, stores climate data spanning millennia . "These weather events and their diverse consequences should also be considered in climate and ocean models," explains Oltmanns. "After all, ice loss in Greenland is also a significant factor in global sea-level rise."
