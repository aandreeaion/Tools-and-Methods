100,000 Pounds of Invasive Fish Pulled from Kansas River
Wildlife biologists have removed more than 100,000 pounds of invasive Asian carp from the Kansas River over the past three years, with 2025 marking the most successful year to date at 36,863 pounds removed.
Why It Matters
State officials said the mass removals are intended to protect native fish and reduce risks to boaters, as the fast-growing carp outcompete native species and silver carp can leap when startled, potentially striking people on the water, according to Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks (KDWP) statements.
What To Know
KDWP biologists have removed approximately 109,000 pounds of invasive carp from the Kansas River since organized efforts began in 2022, reaching the 100,000-pound milestone at the end of 2025.

Annual totals reported by state officials were 25,339 pounds in 2022, 25,949 pounds in 2023, 21,649 pounds in 2024 and 36,863 pounds in 2025, as reported by local outlet KSNT.

The campaign targets silver, bighead and black carp, which were introduced to the United States decades ago for aquaculture and later spread through Midwestern waterways, where they consume large amounts of food and crowd out native fish, according to KDWP accounts.
Officials said the agency uses electrofishing, gill nets and specialized gear, including an electrified dozer trawl that stuns fish and collects them as boats move through infested waters, with methods adjusted by season and conditions.

In 2025, KDWP expanded removal operations by about 15 miles downstream on the Kansas River, and the Bowersock Dam in Lawrence continues to serve as a barrier limiting upstream movement, according to agency information.

A broader regional push included a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announcement in August 2025 of nearly $19 million for invasive carp management across 18 states in the Mississippi River basin, with funding directed to removal, monitoring and prevention projects.
What People Are Saying
Liam Odell, invasive carp biologist from the KDWP, told KSNT: “These removal efforts appear to have produced positive effects in Kansas waterways and for native species.

“We now use some specialized equipment, including an electrified dozer trawl designed specifically for invasive carp removal. 

“This system stuns fish using electricity, similar to standard electrofishing, while a push trawl mounted on the bow collects stunned carp as the boat moves forward. 

“Standard electrofishing and gill netting are still used, as each method is more effective at different times of year and under varying conditions.”
What Happens Next
KDWP will continue year-round removals and may expand operations as research and funding allow, and officials will encourage the public not to release invasive carp and to report sightings outside known infested waters, according to national reporting of agency plans.
