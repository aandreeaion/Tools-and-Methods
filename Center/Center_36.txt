Care-Report: Little attention paid to Africa
Many invisible crises in the world
Wars, famine, and climate disasters: Many humanitarian crises go largely unnoticed. A new report by the aid organization CARE International reveals which emergencies have been overlooked.
While the wedding of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in Venice and the temporary ban of the video platform TikTok in the US made headlines in online media worldwide last year, many emergencies around the globe went unnoticed. This is shown in a new report by the aid organization CARE International.The major crises, particularly in Africa, were practically invisible. For example, very few reports appeared about the Central African Republic – even though armed attacks, destroyed hospitals, and closed schools are commonplace there, and more than two million people are in need of aid.
Crises in Africa are complex and long-lastingThe worst drought in Namibia in 100 years, the floods in Zambia, or the famine in Zimbabwe: all of this hardly played a role in the reporting.These emergencies often go unnoticed because they drag on for years, says Charlene Ambali of CARE Zimbabwe. "For us in Africa, crises are usually long-lasting, insidious, and complex—not sudden or rapid," Ambali explains. That's why attention often gets lost.
News dominated by Ukraine, Gaza and TrumpThe CARE report analyzed approximately five million online articles in five languages ​​published worldwide between January and September of last year. According to the report, global news in 2025 was dominated by the wars in Ukraine and the Gaza Strip, major natural disasters, and also by US President Donald Trump.Karl-Otto Zentel, Secretary General of CARE Germany, sees the reason in the context of the media market: "For Germany, the war in Ukraine is much more relevant because of the geographical, political and economic interconnections." He added that it is also a natural phenomenon that pop culture topics generate more attention, as they can appeal to a broad audience.
Attention has real consequences.The lack of attention has concrete consequences for crisis-stricken countries. Where little attention is paid, the resources for humanitarian aid are often lacking – partly because fewer donations are being made, explains Andrea Barschdorf-Hager, Managing Director of CARE Austria."In 2025, global appeals for aid were only one-third funded," laments Barschdorf-Hager. Major donors such as the USA, Germany, Sweden, and Austria had drastically cut their financial assistance. This had "forced difficult decisions – with real consequences for health, food security, protection, and care, especially for women and girls."
There was also a positive development in crisis reporting.However, the aid organization also observes opposing trends in its reporting. For example, constructive journalism, which focuses on solutions, is gaining increasing importance.Reports from countries like Malawi not only describe hunger and drought, but also the transition to climate-resilient seeds and more effective irrigation systems. Furthermore, affected communities could share their stories directly and unfiltered on social media to raise awareness of humanitarian crises.According to CARE International, this is precisely what matters. Every story told and every crisis brought to light increases the pressure on decision-makers. Because being forgotten has real consequences, the aid organization emphasizes – for funding, visibility, and human dignity.
