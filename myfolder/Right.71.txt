Polar Vortex Now Has Millions In Over 35 States Threatened By Potentially Historic, Catastrophic Winter Storm
A gargantuan winter storm, aided by a deep surge of Arctic air, is forecast to affect over half of the population in the United States, delivering widespread hazardous weather, such as heavy snow and ice accumulations.

According to the most recent short-range forecast discussion from the National Weather Service (NWS), an Arctic cold front will usher in “frigid sub-zero and single digit temperatures” across two-thirds of the nation by Sunday.
This bitterly cold air mass will assist the generation of what forecasters are describing as “a major winter storm.” The event is expected to impact areas from the central and southern Plains to the East Coast starting Friday, and persist through early next week.

Significant uncertainty remains, particularly regarding the storm’s exact track, as meteorologists continue refining models to determine how far north the heaviest precipitation will extend.

Snowfall could potentially develop Friday across the South, with winter weather spreading into the Southeast by Saturday, per the FOX Forecast Center. Dangerous levels of icing are anticipated throughout the event, possibly affecting over a dozen states stretching from Texas to Delaware.
Extremely cold conditions are expected to prevail both during and after the system, raising risks of hazardous road conditions, as well as home-related dangers, such as frozen and bursting pipes, according to AccuWeather.

The prolonged cold snap is being driven by a polar vortex that has already begun dipping southward into the United States and is projected to affect the country until the end of January.

“Potentially hundreds of thousands of people may go without electricity and heat for days,” stated AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jonathan Porter.
Current forecasts indicate that parts of several states — which include Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia — could receive a foot of snowfall, with isolated areas potentially seeing accumulations as high as 18 inches, according to the FOX Forecast Center.
Farther east, the greatest snowfall totals are projected along a corridor from Nashville into western North Carolina, where two feet of snow could fall in portions of the Appalachian Mountains.

Uncertainty lingers regarding the storm’s precise effects on the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, although states in those areas are already making preparations for significant winter weather impacts.

Along the East Coast, the strongest potential for heavy, accumulating snow currently centers on central Virginia, Maryland, and southern New Jersey.

The storm’s eventual track will play a decisive role in determining snowfall amounts across the Northeast into Monday afternoon. A path farther to the north would increase the likelihood of higher totals in that area.

In addition to heavy precipitation, the accompanying Arctic blast is forecast to produce strong, gusty winds. The National Weather Service warns that these winds will generate “dangerous wind chills,” potentially dropping as low as -50°F in parts of the Northern Plains.
As of Wednesday, extreme cold watches, warnings, and advisories are already active across sections of the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest.

A number of major metropolitan areas stand to be significantly affected by the winter storm, such as Dallas, Austin, Oklahoma City, Nashville, Atlanta, Charlotte, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City, and Boston, per AccuWeather.

The National Weather Service has issued Winter Storm Watches covering a broad region from central New Mexico eastward to central Tennessee and northern Georgia, encompassing much of Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas.

This widespread winter event is projected to affect an estimated 175 million people across the United States, according to the FOX Forecast Center.
