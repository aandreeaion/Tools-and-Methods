The storm tears off several roofs of warehouses in an industrial park in Ibiza and buries two cars
Local police have closed off the area and, for safety reasons, three businesses in the industrial park where the incident occurred were allowed to open this Monday.
Two cars were buried in Ibiza after several sheets of roofing material were torn off a commercial building in the Eurocentro industrial park. Both panels were ripped from the roof by strong gusts of wind. It is one of the most striking images left by the storm, and fortunately, it only resulted in material damage.
The material fell with such force that it buried the vehicles under the remains of the roof , forcing municipal services to intervene to secure the area and remove the debris.
Local police have closed off the area, and for safety reasons, three businesses in the industrial park where the incident occurred were allowed to open on Monday while the damage is assessed and cleanup and restoration work is carried out. The access road has been rendered "completely impassable" in some sections after the wind impacted the metal structures and other elements in the area.

But the incidents weren't limited to this one. At least 15 trees were downed by the wind in various parts of the municipality, blocking streets, damaging street furniture , and prompting emergency interventions throughout the day. Furthermore, between 6:00 p.m. on Sunday and 9:30 a.m. on Monday, 54 incidents related to fallen trees were recorded across the island of Ibiza, causing traffic disruptions and numerous calls to emergency services to remove trunks and debris.
This episode is part of a widespread spell of bad weather that has been affecting the Balearic archipelago for weeks. Following the passage of storms Harry and Ingrid, a new low-pressure system named Joseph has entered the area, prolonging the adverse weather with strong winds, persistent showers, and rough seas for several days.
The weather forecast includes typical wind gusts between 70 and 90 km/h, with peaks that could exceed 100 km/h in exposed areas, especially in elevated areas facing the Tramontana wind or in open stretches of coastline. In addition, waves have reached heights of 4 to 5 meters in several coastal areas, triggering coastal hazard warnings across all the islands.
Rain has also played a key role in this new weather front : although Ibiza and Formentera may register somewhat lower amounts than in other parts of the archipelago, intense and stormy showers are expected in short periods of time, which may contribute to significant accumulations of water in specific locations.
In total, since the beginning of this series of storms, emergency services have handled more than 300 calls in the Balearic Islands, including numerous cases of fallen trees, branches, streetlights, flooding in garages and basements, and water removal from commercial premises.
Authorities have reinforced emergency response measures in anticipation of the unstable situation continuing for at least several days, recommending securing objects on balconies, limiting travel during the peak of the storm, and avoiding the coast while adverse conditions persist.
