"Worse than the blue crab." The sea nut invades the Venice lagoon: why it's dangerous.
One of the world's most dangerous invasive species, the sea nut is spreading across the Venice lagoon. Scientists warn: it could have an impact on the entire ecosystem, even more serious than the blue crab.

A new alarm in the Venice lagoon is quiet, barely visible, but it could become an even more serious threat than the blue crab. For years, an invasive organism capable of profoundly altering the balance of the lagoon ecosystem has been spreading through the waters of the Venice lagoon .

The invisible invader comes from the sea
This is Mnemiopsis leidyi , a ctenophore known as the sea nut , present in the Adriatic Sea for about a decade and now particularly problematic in lagoon areas. A recent study conducted by the University of Padua and the National Institute of Oceanography and Experimental Geophysics ( OGS ), published in the scientific journal Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science, precisely identifies its behavior and risks.

Among the most dangerous species in the world
The sea walnut is among the 100 most harmful invasive species globally. Its danger is primarily linked to its extraordinary ability to adapt , making it particularly vulnerable to the current warming of the seas. In a fragile context like Venice, this characteristic could translate into a serious ecological risk.

Fast playback
According to the researchers, Mnemiopsis leidyi exhibits a well-defined seasonal pattern, with peaks of massive reproduction between late spring and early summer, and a second critical point between late summer and autumn. These numerical explosions appear to be favored by higher temperatures and salinity levels particularly suited to the species.

An extraordinary resistance
Laboratory analyses, combined with observations in natural environments, have revealed that the sea nut can survive in very different conditions, temperatures between 10 and 32 degrees and salinity ranging from 10 to 34. Only the extremes of these values, excessive heat or very dilute water, seem to partially limit its survival.

Climate and lagoon: a risky combination
Climate change could make the Venice lagoon increasingly hospitable to this ctenophore. Warmer and more stable environments would favor the formation of large aggregations , with potential knock-on effects on plankton, fish, and the entire functioning of the lagoon ecosystem.
Monitor to limit damage
According to experts, Mnemiopsis leidyi is now destined to become a permanent presence.
For this reason, the priority is to monitor its spread and develop flexible management strategies capable of reducing not only the environmental impact but also the economic and social consequences associated with its expansion.
