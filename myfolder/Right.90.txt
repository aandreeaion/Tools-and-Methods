Pakistan warns UN of water security crisis after India’s IWT move
Pakistan has warned that India’s unilateral decision to hold the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) in abeyance has triggered an unprecedented crisis for the country’s water security and poses serious risks to regional stability.

The concerns were voiced by Pakistan’s Acting Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Usman Jadoon, while speaking at the Global Water Bankruptcy Policy Roundtable hosted by the Permanent Mission of Canada and the United Nations University (UNU).

Ambassador Jadoon said India’s decision, taken in April last year, was followed by what he described as material breaches of the treaty, including unannounced disruptions in downstream water flows and the withholding of crucial hydrological data. He termed the move a deliberate “weaponisation of water” and reiterated that Pakistan’s stance on the Indus Waters Treaty was clear and firm.
“Pakistan’s position is unequivocal: the Treaty remains legally intact and permits no unilateral suspension or modification,” he said.

He noted that for more than six decades, the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 had served as a time-tested framework for the equitable and predictable management of the Indus Basin. Highlighting the basin’s significance, he said it sustains one of the world’s largest contiguous irrigation systems, meets more than 80 per cent of Pakistan’s agricultural water requirements and supports the lives and livelihoods of over 240 million people.
The ambassador warned that water insecurity had emerged as a systemic risk worldwide, affecting food production, energy systems, public health, livelihoods and overall human security.

Referring to Pakistan’s own challenges, he said the country is a semi-arid, climate-vulnerable, lower-riparian state facing recurring floods and droughts, accelerated glacier melt, groundwater depletion and rapid population growth — all of which are placing immense pressure on already strained water resources.

He said Pakistan is taking steps to enhance water resilience through integrated planning, flood protection, irrigation rehabilitation, groundwater recharge and ecosystem restoration, citing initiatives such as Living Indus and Recharge Pakistan.
Ambassador Jadoon stressed that systemic water risks cannot be addressed by any country in isolation, particularly in shared river basins. He said predictability, transparency and cooperation in transboundary water governance were essential for the survival of downstream populations.

He also called for water insecurity to be recognised as a systemic global risk in the run-up to the UN Water Conference 2026, urging that cooperation and respect for international water law be placed at the centre of shared water governance to safeguard vulnerable downstream communities.
