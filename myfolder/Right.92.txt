Davos: Joshi Calls for Investments in India’s Renewable Energy Surge
At the prestigious Davos summit, India’s New and Renewable Energy Minister Pralhad Joshi issued a clarion call to investors worldwide: bet big on India’s clean energy future. During the World Economic Forum on January 20, he detailed India’s accelerated progress in solar, onshore and offshore wind, green hydrogen production, and advanced energy storage systems.

In a focused bilateral with Canada’s La Caisse leadership—President & CEO Charles Émond and COO Sara Buschard—Joshi explored deepening commitments to India’s green transition. Their exchange, as shared on X, encompassed scaling hybrid renewables, fortifying grid transmission, and innovating in hydrogen and storage domains.

Joshi recommended supercharging the ‘Partner with India’ drive to capture substantial portions of the $400 billion climate finance target for 2030. The mutual alignment of visions between India and La Caisse sets the stage for transformative, scalable clean energy outcomes.

Equally vital was Joshi’s dialogue with Oman’s economic advisor Dr. Said Al Sakri, centering on enhanced renewable energy synergies. India’s demonstrated expertise in deploying projects across arid zones offers compelling prospects for forward-thinking investors.

Key areas of joint focus included production and export of solar components, electrolysers, and green hydrogen. Investments in renewable-fueled hydrogen ecosystems, unified energy developments, and maritime export hubs were prioritized. Building on CEPA, shared investment vehicles, and ISA platforms, conversations advanced OSOWOG and interconnected global green networks.

Prospects for teamed tenders in solar and wind auctions, plus innovation incentives for industries, promise a vibrant collaboration pipeline. Joshi’s Davos diplomacy reinforces India’s leadership in sustainable energy, attracting capital for a greener tomorrow.
