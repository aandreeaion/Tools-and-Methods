Smog warning in northern half of the country
Air quality in the northern half of the country is currently poor in many places, and even bad in some places, according to measurements by the RIVM (National Institute for Public Health and the Environment). The Institute for Public Health and the Environment has issued a smog warning due to the amount of particulate matter in the air. This applies particularly to the part of the country north of the Amsterdam-Arnhem line .
High concentrations of particulate matter can cause health problems, such as decreased lung function. This can be particularly problematic for people with lung conditions.
The RIVM advises people with asthma, bronchitis and cardiovascular diseases, for example, not to exert themselves too much and to consult a doctor if necessary.
Little wind
The easterly wind is bringing extra particulate matter into the Netherlands, leading to the higher concentrations. These are spreading from Groningen and Drenthe to the south and west of the country. Because there's hardly any wind, the smog lingers for a long time. Cleaner air is expected tonight, when the wind shifts to the northeast and later to the north.
Smog is not very common in the Netherlands. The number of days with smog has also decreased since measurements began in 1992. This is partly due to continuous efforts to improve air quality .
Winter smog
Smog usually occurs when there's little or no wind, causing air pollution to linger longer. In winter, it's mostly particulate matter; in summer, it's primarily ozone.
Winter smog occurs primarily during weak to moderate easterly winds, when polluted air is drawn in from the east, along with emissions from the eastern Netherlands. Fine particulate matter is also created by fireworks around New Year's Eve.
