India is dying of dirty air, and no one is held to account: Lancet editor
Lancet editor-in-chief Richard Horton asks why India's democracy isn't demanding clean air.
The Indian government’s failure to take air pollution seriously is both mysterious and bizarre, Lancet editor-in-chief Richard Horton has said, arguing that the deeper problem lies in public apathy and the absence of political accountability.

In an interview with India Today, Horton said it was troubling that India, despite being a vibrant democracy, has failed to confront an escalating public health crisis, even as China acted decisively after years of choking smog in cities such as Beijing.
Globally known for his advocacy of population and planetary health and for shaping international health policy, Horton said he was shocked by the lack of public agitation in India over pollution.

“India being such a vigorous democracy, I find it problematic. Why isn’t the public agitated? Why aren’t they asking more questions of the government? Why are they not saying this is unacceptable, and if you do not resolve it, we will vote you out?” he asked.

His remarks come amid growing concern from economists and health experts alike.

On Wednesday, economist and Harvard University professor Gita Gopinath said at an event at the World Economic Forum in Geneva that air pollution, not trade tariffs, posed the biggest threat to the Indian economy at present.

Citing a World Bank report, she noted that air pollution caused an estimated 17 lakh deaths in India in 2022.
A World Bank report released last week underscored the scale of the crisis, stating that 100 percent of India’s 1.4 billion population is exposed to unhealthy levels of ambient PM2.5, the most harmful air pollutant, generated from multiple sources.

Nearly no major Indian city records an air quality index of 50 or below—the level considered “good”—for much of the year. Large parts of northern India frequently cross AQI levels of 400, particularly during winter. Delhi and its surrounding regions routinely rank among the most polluted urban areas in the world.

SLOW DEATH = NO ACCOUNTABILITY

Horton believes the slow, cumulative nature of pollution-related deaths allows both the public and policymakers to evade responsibility.

“High pollution levels cause cardiovascular disease, respiratory conditions, even lung cancers, but none of this happens in a day, a week or even a year,” he said. “The pollution you are exposed to in January 2026 will show its effect 12, 18 or 24 months later.”

“If I get hit by a car, life is snuffed out instantly. That is not what happens with pollution,” Horton added, explaining why the crisis fails to provoke the urgency it deserves.

Policymakers, he said, are fully aware that the worst effects lie in the future and therefore feel little pressure to act now.
Drawing a contrast with China, Horton recalled how severe pollution in Beijing once felt almost tangible.

Faced with undeniable health risks, authorities shut down highly polluting industries in and around cities and imposed strict limits on vehicle use.

“Going to Beijing now feels like going to the countryside, air-wise. It’s so clean and beautiful,” said Horton, who is also an honorary professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
