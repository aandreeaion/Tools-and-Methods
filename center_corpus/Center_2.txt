Climate crisis failure of global justice: minister
Minister also called for global accountability, pointing out imbalance between financial profits, environmental costs.
LAHORE:
Federal Minister for Climate Change Dr Musadik Malik on Saturday said that the global climate crisis should be viewed not merely as an environmental challenge but as a failure of international cooperation and justice.

Addressing a session on the second day of ThinkFest 2026 at the Alhamra Arts Council, Dr Malik stressed the need to move beyond isolated scientific research and adopt what he termed "scientific diplomacy." He said science has the unique power to bridge divides between nations, enabling collaboration through shared research and global projects despite political differences. "Science is the only language that remains universal," he remarked.

Highlighting Pakistan's vulnerability to climate change, the minister noted that the country contributes less than one percent to global carbon emissions yet remains among the hardest hit by climate-related disasters. For developing nations, he said, scientific collaboration is a necessity for survival rather than a luxury.

The minister also called for global accountability, pointing out the imbalance between financial profits and environmental costs. He said countries that benefit the most from carbon-intensive industries often face the least immediate consequences, while poorer nations bear the brunt of climate impacts.

"It is fundamentally wrong for profit to be privatized by the few while the climatic consequences are socialized among the many," he said, urging the creation of a global mechanism to hold high-emitting countries financially accountable.

Dr Malik's remarks were warmly received by the audience, positioning Pakistan as a strong voice for climate justice. He urged the international community to reshape global policies based on data and ethics to ensure a fair and inclusive response to climate change.
