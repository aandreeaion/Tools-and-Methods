Nigerian government bans sand mining on River Niger  
The Federal Government has announced a ban on sand mining within a 10-kilometre radius of the River Niger to protect the first and second Niger bridges.
The Minister of Works, Mr David Umahi, disclosed this on Friday in Asaba during the commissioning of the Second Niger Bridge Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) Cameras Monitoring Centre.

He said the decision was taken by the Federal Executive Council as part of efforts to protect critical federal infrastructure across the country.
According to him, tolling on the Second Niger Bridge will not begin until all access roads at the Anambra and Delta sections are completed.

He added that the CCTV monitoring centre was to ensure adequate security along the federal highway.
“The tollgate is ready, but we won’t start tolling on the road until we complete the access roads and bypass roads that lead to the bridge.

“The idea is that there will be no security checkpoints on the road; police and other security agencies will be at the CCTV monitoring centre and provide rapid response to emergencies within five minutes,” he added.

Umahi directed the Police Command in Delta State to ensure implementation of the ban as well as the arrest of offenders.
In his remarks, the Asagba of Asaba, Prof. Epiphany Azinge, commended the Federal Government for effectively completing the Second Niger Bridge and enumerated the socio-economic benefits of the project.

On his part, the Chairman, Anambra State Council of Traditional Rulers, the Igwe of Obosi, Chidubem Iweka, said that the opening of the bridge has reduced traffic on the first bridge and eased movement during and after the yuletide.

Iweka expressed optimism that the installation of the security cameras would boost the confidence of commuters plying the road.
He called for the speedy completion of the access roads to the Second Niger Bridge.
