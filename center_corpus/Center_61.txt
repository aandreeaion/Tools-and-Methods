A winter storm, a viral claim and what the science actually says
After President Trump pointed to a winter storm as evidence against global warming, North Carolina scientists point to decades of warming winter data.
As snow and ice spread across North Carolina over the weekend, President Donald Trump pointed to the cold as evidence that climate change is exaggerated.

“Record Cold Wave expected to hit 40 States,” Mr. Trump wrote Friday on Truth Social, adding, “WHATEVER HAPPENED TO GLOBAL WARMING???”
Climate scientists say the claim reflects a common misunderstanding: confusing short-term weather with long-term climate trends.

“We’re in the climatologically coldest part of the year right now,” said Corey Davis, a climatologist with the North Carolina State Climate Office. “So it’s not surprising that we’re seeing cold weather, snow and ice in mid to late January. Climate change isn’t about eliminating winter. It’s about changing how often these events happen.”

In North Carolina, those changes are already visible.

While the state still experiences winter storms, they are occurring less frequently than in past decades. This system marked the first accumulating snow event of the season for much of the state, arriving late in January. In the 1980s and 1990s, Davis said, multiple snowfalls by this point in the winter were typical.
Long-term data show a clear shift. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, winter temperatures in North Carolina have warmed steadily over the past half-century, with nighttime lows increasing by about 1 degree Fahrenheit per decade. That gradual warming has pushed average winter low temperatures above freezing, a change with outsized effects on snowfall.

“Back in the ’70s and ’80s, Raleigh averaged more than eight inches of snow a year,” Davis said. “Now, based on 30-year averages, that number is closer to five inches. Warmer overnight temperatures mean fewer snow events and more marginal storms.”

Those marginal temperatures are also reshaping the kinds of winter storms the region experiences. Instead of widespread snow, many systems now produce a mix of sleet, freezing rain and heavy rain — combinations that can be more damaging.

“When we look at a storm like this, it really has two parts,” Davis said. “You need cold air from the north, but you also need warm, moist air coming in from the south. And that warm air is becoming more dominant.”

That dynamic helped drive extreme ice accumulations in parts of the Southeast this weekend. In Oxford, Mississippi, about two inches of ice were reported — an amount Davis described as both destructive and revealing.
“That’s also an extreme precipitation event,” Davis said. “One of the biggest changes we’ve seen with climate change in this region is heavier precipitation, not just from hurricanes, but from everyday winter systems.”

Scientists say those extremes do not contradict global warming. A warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture and energy, increasing the likelihood of intense rainfall, even when surface temperatures are cold enough for ice.

Another factor is the polar vortex, a band of strong winds that usually keeps Arctic air confined near the North Pole. When it weakens, cold air can plunge south into the United States. But that weakening is linked to unusually warm conditions in the Arctic.

“For the polar vortex to get that weak, you need extreme warmth in the upper atmosphere around the poles,” Davis said. “So while we’re cold here, places like northern Canada and parts of Siberia are experiencing unusually warm conditions.”

That imbalance is why scientists caution against using a single storm to draw conclusions about climate change.

“Just because it’s cold in one place doesn’t mean the planet isn’t warming,” Davis said. “In fact, during some of our coldest weeks in North Carolina, the globe as a whole has been setting heat records.”

Climate change, he added, does not mean temperatures rise steadily everywhere at all times. It means the baseline is shifting — toward warmer winters overall, sharper swings between extremes, and storms that increasingly fall on the margins between snow, ice and rain.
