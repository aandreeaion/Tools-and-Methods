Grange-raised conservationist named 30 Under 30 finalist
A conservationist who grew up in Grange has been named among the world’s top young environmental educators.
Lyndon Howson, 28, has been named a finalist in the EE 30 Under 30 programme, which aims to celebrate emerging talent in environmental education around the world

The scheme, run by the North American Association for Environmental Education (NAAEE), is designed to honour young professionals who are using education and community engagement to drive environmental change.

Mr Howson said: "Environmental education starts close to home.
"If people feel connected to nature where they live, they’re far more likely to want to protect it."

He currently works as a wildlife and wellbeing officer at Chester Zoo, helping people connect with nature through conservation projects and wellbeing-focused outreach.

His background in nature goes back to childhood.
Mr Howson said: "Being surrounded by countryside and wildlife made me curious from a young age.

"Those early experiences really stayed with me and shaped the direction I wanted to take."

After studying zoology, he went on to work in a variety of conservation and public engagement roles before joining Chester Zoo.

One of his standout projects was leading a hedgehog conservation scheme at the University of Chester, which grew from a small group into a network of more than 170 volunteers.

The programme focused on creating habitats, raising public awareness, and taking hands-on action to support one of the UK’s most at-risk mammals.

Mr Howson has also delivered free storytelling workshops in schools and community settings, blending wildlife science with storytelling all with the aim of making nature more accessible to young people.

He said: "Facts and figures are important."
"But stories are often what help people remember why wildlife matters. If you can spark curiosity and emotional connection, that can lead to long-term change."

Being named alongside other young leaders from around the world has reinforced his belief in the power of local action.
