Social media ices out Trump over climate change claims as US braces for record cold
Social media users iced out President Donald Trump after the Republican got political over a massive winter storm that’s expected to thump the United States this weekend.

“Record Cold Wave expected to hit 40 States. Rarely seen anything like it before. Could the Environmental Insurrectionists please explain — WHATEVER HAPPENED TO GLOBAL WARMING???” Trump posted to his Truth Social site on Friday.
Massachusetts is about to be plunged into its coldest weekend of the winter, then hit by the biggest snowstorm of the season — potentially dumping up to 2 feet of snow in some areas — leaving residents with less than 48 hours to prepare, MassLive reported.
Boston Mayor Michelle Wu has already declared a cold emergency and activated warming centers in the city, as an arctic front is set to send temperatures plummeting to the single digits on Friday night.
Temperatures will remain frigid through the weekend, dipping below zero in some areas of Western Massachusetts. Wind chill readings will hit minus 10 degrees in Boston on Saturday and Sunday.

By the time temperatures begin to warm on Sunday, a snowstorm will be hammering the state. The National Weather Service has issued a Winter Storm Warning for the entire state beginning at 7 a.m. Sunday, with forecasts of 12 to 18 inches of snow across Massachusetts.

Social media posters gave Trump’s rhetoric a frosty reception.

“Greenland seems to have sent its weather for Trump,” one wrote, alluding to Trump’s drive to take over the Arctic country, MassLive’s sibling site, SILive reported.

“Of course, Trump doesn’t understand the difference between weather and climate,” another offered.
