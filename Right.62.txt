Poland Must Pay Fine Over Border Coal Mine, ECJ Rules
The European Court of Justice (ECJ) on Thursday, January 22nd, dismissed Poland’s appeal against daily fines related to the Turow coal mine, which stretches along the German and Czech borders. The court confirmed that the fines imposed by the European Commission are lawful and necessary to ensure compliance with EU law. 

The Turow mine, spanning over 10 kilometres, has been a source of tension with Poland’s neighbours. The Czech Republic and Germany have argued that mining operations have lowered groundwater levels, depleted minerals from the soil, and caused environmental damage to surrounding areas.

In 2021, the Czech Republic brought the case to the ECJ, alleging that Poland’s mining activities violated EU law. Poland was ordered to halt operations but did not comply, prompting the European Commission to impose daily fines of €500,000. Warsaw argued that the EU was overstepping its authority and that closing the mine would harm Poland’s energy security.

In 2022, Poland reached a settlement with the Czech Republic but continued to contest the Commission’s fines, which had accumulated to approximately €68.5 million. The ECJ rejected Poland’s claims that the fines were punitive, stating that they serve a preventive role to ensure adherence to interim measures and the effective application of EU law.
